        <h2>Maid-Rite</h2>
        <p>Maid-Rite is a fast food restaurant with multiple locations around the US. 
            The one I worked at was at Lamoni, Iowa; my home town.
            I worked at Maid-Rite for about 7 Months and I found the experience very helpful because I was 15 and it was my first real job.
            I didn't gain any technological skills but i gained great work ethic, and a desire for quality work. 
            Having to clean the restaurant every single day became a desire to get promoted to cook.
            The work environment was very friendly and I loved working there.</p>

        <h2>Lifeguard</h2>
        <p>I Lifeguarded at the town pool in Lamoni Iowa. I worked at the pool for a Summer of 2023 so May to August. 
            I had to take a lifegaurding class and get my CPR certification to become a lifegaurd.
            The work was casual with 15 minutes on the stand but I always have to be on alert. 
            Some Skills I gained were focus, social skills, efficiency, and teamwork.
            Our team of lifegaurds had to work together to keep everyone safe and following the rules.
            Someone Once slipped on the diving board and scraped all of the skin from there leg and I wrapped them
            up and cleaned the wound. Very important job.
